# Who's that Pokémon? Game

This Java project is a small version of the game we used to see in the Pokémon show back in the day. It shows the user a silhouette of a random Pokémon and three options to try to guess the Pokémon's name correctly.

# Motivation

I came up with this game as my final project for an Intermediate Programming class, where we focused on Object Oriented Programming. I wanted to implement GUIs and give the project a fun twist by developing a game that I would actually enjoy playing.

# Build status

Althought the game is finished, it currently has only 50 Pokémon and I would like to expand it to include all the 1st Generation Pokémon (151). I'm also planning on building a web version of this game, to facilitate access to it and be able to share it with friends and whoever might be interested.

At it's current status, the game's functionality has a lot of space for improvement and I'd like to work on make it better soon.
