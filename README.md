# Who's that Pokémon? Game

This Java project is a small version of the game we used to see in the Pokémon show back in the day. It shows the user a silhouette of a random Pokémon and three options to try to guess the Pokémon's name correctly.

# Motivation

I came up with this game as my final project for an Intermediate Programming class, where we focused on Object Oriented Programming. I wanted to implement GUIs and give the project a fun twist by developing a game that I would actually enjoy playing.
